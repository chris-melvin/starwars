    32 Years before Episode 4, Young Jedi Padawan Obi Wan Kenobi and his master Qui Gon Jin are on
    Planet
    Naboo when the
    Trade Federation Attacks with a droid Army. Naboo politician Senator Palpatine overthrows the
    Chancellor and takes his
    place, because the Senate would not help f!ght off the droid army. They flee with the Queen of
    Naboo,
    Padme Amidada to
    Tattooine, where they meet Anakin Skywalker, a slave boy born of a virgin who has extreme levels of
    the
    force with no
    training. They barter for his release by having Anakin win a pod-race, and bring him to the Jedi
    Council to approve his
    training. Mace Windu, and the council allows Qui Gon to train Anakin, and Obi Wan to become a Jedi
    Master, and take him
    back to Naboo, where they defeat the Trade Federation with Anakin destroying their space station.
    Sith
    Master Darth
    Maul f!ghts and k!lls Qui Gon in the process, and Obi Wan cuts him in half immediately after. Young
    Anakin, Obi Wan,
    and others are honored for defeating the droids. Obi Wan takes Anakin as his apprentice.

        Years later, the Trade Federation has more droids and launches war upon the Galactic Senate. The
        Jedi council fears
        Padme is in danger after an attempt on her life and a.ssigns Obi Wan and Anakin to protect her.
        They find out there's
        an a.ssassin and Anakin and Padme travel to Naboo for refuge where they fall in love, a direct
        violation of Jedi
        practice. Obi Wan follows the a.ssassin and finds out that a clone army has been made for the Jedi
        to lead from the
        a.ssassin's genes. Anakin has visions of his mother dying, so he goes to his home planet and is too
        late to save her,
        so he slaughters the entire Tusken village in rage. Obi Wan tracks the a.ssassin to another planet
        and learns that
        Count Dooku has taken over for Darth Maul, and is leading the Trade Federation, but gets capgtured,
        Anakin and Padme
        find out and try to save him, but they too are captured. The rest of the Jedi save them with the
        clone army, and Dooku
        cuts off Anakins arm in a f!ght, then flees when his former master, Yoda, just owns his force
        powers. They all go back
        to the city planet Coruscant and see the Clone Army is ready.

                    Anakin begins having visions of her dying as she gives birth. Fearing that she will die, Palpatine
                    reveals that he has
                    studied in the Force and the dark side, but that he has the power to prevent death. Anakin reveals

                    Story begins above desert Planet above Tattooine, where cyborg sith master Darth Vader kidnaps
                    Princess Leia Organa.
                    Two droids from her ship escape with information on how to destroy the evil empire's space station
                    and land on the
                    planet, and make their way to Luke Skywalker. Luke finds the message and meets up with Obi Wan
                    Kenobi, who travel with
                    smuggler Han Solo to the planet Alderaan, home planet of Leia. On the way, Obi Wan tells Luke that

                    The Empire is now chasing down and locating the Rebel Alliance, and they are hiding on frozen
                    planet Hoth. Luke, Han,
                    and Leia are all on Hoth. Luke gets lost in the snow and a vision of Obi Wan in a blizzard tells
                    Luke to visit a jedi
                    master named Yoda. A probe droid from the Empire finds the base, and Darth Vader comes and destroys

                    Han Solo is still frozen in carbonite but has been brought to Jabba the Hut, a gangster on
                    Tattooine. Leia tries to

                    himself be captured,
                    saves all of them in the process, with Lando. Luke then travels to Yoda one last time to finish
                    training. Yoda dies,
                    but confirms that Vader was telling the truth, and Obi Wan's spirit reveals that he must confront
                    Vader to become a
                    Jedi. He also tells him that Leia is his twin sister. The Empire has begun building a second death
                    Star, which is
                    functional. Luke f!ghts Vader a second time as Vader's master, The Emperor watches, and succumbs to
                    his anger, and owns
                    Vader, but realizes he is becoming evil, and spares him. The Emperor in turn begins k!lling Luke
